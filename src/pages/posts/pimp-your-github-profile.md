I find my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/rebelchris) crucial for being an active developer. Unfortunately, most of my projects are private due to business requirements. But still, it's a showcase of who you are.

So let's dive into pimping your profile but adding a custom readme!

## Adding a Readme

Let's start by adding a .readme; this will allow us to create our little teaser of who we are.

To add this readme, visit the following URL and create a new repository.

[GitHub New Repo](https://github.com/new), The name should be the same as your username. (Rebelchris/rebelchris for me).

You will now see an 8-bit giggling GitHub Octocat and the notice you found the unique repository. Make sure to add the .readme here!

## Styling your Readme

Of course, it's now up to you to style your readme page; there are some fantastic examples!

You can use markdown to style it; of course, we can use the repo to store images!

For example, I created an asset folder and uploaded it for my header. Then I'm using the following to add it to the .readme.

```html
[![Rebelchris
header](https://github.com/rebelchris/rebelchris/blob/master/assets/github-header.png)](https://daily-dev-tips.com)
```

Another cool thing to add is the [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). Follow instructions on the repo to get something like this:

```html
<img
  align="center"
  src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/?username=rebelchris&theme=dracula"
/>
```

Mine is still very basic at this point, but I'm planning on making it more bespoke.
