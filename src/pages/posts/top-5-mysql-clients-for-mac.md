When it comes to databases, MySQL is a big player and widely used.
Today we'll be looking at some MySQL clients we can use on Mac to view these databases.

> TL;DR: My personal favorite for Mac is [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/). It offers a free variant which is sufficient enough.

## 1 TablePlus

TablePlus is the MySQL client I'm using currently.
I'm still on the free plan, which only allows you to have two tabs open at a time, which is enough for me.

#### PROS

- Clear interface
- Quickly edit multiple rows at once
- RAW query always visible

#### CONS

- Only two tabs on the free version
- No click-through for linked queries

## 2 phpMyAdmin

phpMyAdmin is another excellent resource to view your MySQL databases. It's a very good one since most servers will come with phpMyAdmin installed. Making it a good universal interface.

#### PROS

- Close to your server interface for MySQL
- Easy to install
- Web-based

#### CONS

- No syntax highlighting
- Import/Export is web-dependent, making them influenced by the server settings

## 3 DBeaver

DBeaver is a free and open-source database tool. It's built around usability.

This tool is complete and has many cool features. For me, however, it feels a bit too much.

#### PROS

- Packed with useful tools
- ER diagrams!
- Linked query click-through

#### CONS

- A bit clunky for my taste

## 4 Querious

Very Mac like interface and clear to understand how it works and what it does.
I really like the tool however, it should have been a free tool.

![Querious MySQL client for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613899178317/a-Gb7U0wt.png)

#### PROS

- Build for Mac
- Very good interface for MySQL

#### CONS

- 25\$

## 5 Sequel Pro

Sequel Pro used to be my favorite MySQL client for Mac, however, they seem to have a fair amount of crashes lately. The reason I switched to TablePlus.

The tool itself is one of the best UI's for MySQL I've personally seen.

![Sequel Pro MySQL client for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613897251284/24AoENoVF.png)

#### PROS

- Very clear UI
- Easy to understand and use

#### CONS

- Crashes often, unfortunately in the latest releases
