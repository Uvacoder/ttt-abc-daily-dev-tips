Learning CSS can be quite a challenge. There are no shortcuts, and you will have to get your hands dirty and dive into the magical world of CSS.

Flexbox froggy was one of the first CSS-solving games I've played, and I love it.
It's a super fun way to learn flexbox positions across the board.

Another super cool CSS game to learn flex is flexbox defense. In this game, you must move around towers to defend a road from being attacked.

It has 12 levels, and it's pretty cool to see multiple answers can be correct.
